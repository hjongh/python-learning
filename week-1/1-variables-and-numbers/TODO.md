# TODO

What a mess haha. I do not have a reason to build out this content more as of now but I will leave these notes here just in case.

TODO:
- Introduce functions before you start using them in the exercises. You could have exercises that focus on how functions behave even before introducing control flow. Control flow is simpler in a vacuum but functions allow for better workflow (easier testing) so might be a net positive
- More incremental playgrounds that are each grouped with a small bunch of exercises
- More cohesive and incremental exercises
- More difficult and less incremental exercises
- Reorganize content
