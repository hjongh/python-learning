# Setting Up

Complete the following steps:
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git/).
3. Install [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).
    - Problem running Pycharm on Windows: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40204189/error-launching-idea-failed-to-load-jvm-dll-c-program-files-java-jdk1-8-0-112
    - Might have to download an old version of PyCharm if computer is 32-bit

#### TODO:
- Restructure entire course content
- More incremental playgrounds that are each grouped with a small bunch of exercises
- More cohesive and incremental exercises
- More difficult and less incremental exercises
